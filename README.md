# Compounded_String
-> A program to find largest compounded string and second largest compounded string.
-> Step1: Compile the program written in java by using javac i.e (javac CompoundedString.java).
-> Step2: Run the program as (java CompoundedString) and you will get the output.
   The first few line of the program I import the necessary library required to make the program.

-> Logic: I had created an array of string and sorted it in descending order. Checking started from first index of array and if substring      present in that String then it will replace it with null. And atlast if something present in that string then that string will be          invalid and it will continue the array checking.
-> Approach: Bruteforce approach.
